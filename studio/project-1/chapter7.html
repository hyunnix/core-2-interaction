        And surely you have seen, in the darkness of the innermost rooms of these huge buildings, <br> <br>
        to which sunlight never penetrates, how the gold leaf of a sliding door or screen will pick up a distant glimmer from the garden, <br> <br>
        then suddenly send forth an ethereal glow, <br> <br>
        a faint golden light cast into the enveloping darkness, like the glow upon the horizon at sunset. <br> <br>
        In no other setting is gold quite so exquisitely beautiful. <br> <br>
        You walk past, turning to look again, and yet again; <br> <br>
        and as you move away the golden surface of the paper glows ever more deeply, <br> <br>
        changing not in a flash, but growing slowly, steadily brighter, like color rising in the face of a giant. <br> <br>
        Or again you may find that the gold dust of the background, which until that moment had only a dull, sleepy luster, will, <br> <br>
        as you move past, suddenly gleam forth as if it had burst into flame. <br> <br> <br>

        How, in such a dark place, gold draws so much light to itself is a mystery to me. <br> <br>
        But I see why in ancient times statues of the Buddha were gilt with gold and why gold leaf covered the walls of the homes of the nobility. <br> <br>
        Modem man, in his well-lit house, knows nothing of the beauty of gold; <br> <br>
        but those who lived in the dark houses of the past were not merely captivated by its beauty, <br> <br>
        they also knew its practical value; for gold, in these dim rooms, must have served the function of a reflector. <br> <br>
        Their use of gold leaf and gold dust was not mere extravagance. <br> <br>
        Its reflective properties were put to use as a source of illumination. <br> <br>
        Silver and other metals quickly lose their gloss, but gold retains its brilliance indefinitely to light the darkness of the room. <br> <br>
        This is why gold was held in such incredibly high esteem. <br> <br>
