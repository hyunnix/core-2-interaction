    <h1 style="text-align:center;">In Praise of Shadows</h1>
    <p style="text-align:center">"I possess no specialized knowledge of architecture, but I understand that in the Gothic cathedral of the West, the roof is thrust up and up so as to place its pinnacle as high in the heavens as possible-and that herein is thought to lie its special beauty."</p>

    <h2>Introduction to the Theme:</h2>
    <pre>
        In the temples of Japan, on the other hand, <br>
        a roof of heavy tiles is first laid out, and in the deep, <br>
        spacious shadows created by the eaves the rest of the structure is built. <br>
     
        Nor is this true only of temples; <br>
        in the palaces of the nobility and the houses of the common people, <br>
        what first strikes the eye is the massive roof of tile or thatch and the heavy darkness that hangs beneath the eaves. <br>
        Even at midday cavernous darkness spreads over all beneath the roof's edge, <br>
        making entryway, doors, walls, and pillars all but invisible. <br>
     
        The grand temples of Kyoto-Chion'in, <br>
        Honganji-and the farmhouses of the remote countryside are alike in this respect: <br>
        like most buildings of the past their roofs give the impression of possessing far greater weight, <br>
        height, and surface than all that stands beneath the eaves.

    <h2>Comparison with Western Aesthetics:</h2>
    <pre>
        In making for ourselves a place to live, <br>
        we first spread a parasol to throw a shadow on the earth, <br>
        and in the pale light of the shadow we put together a house. <br>
        There are of course roofs on Western houses too, <br>
        but they are less to keep off the sun than to keep off the wind and the dew; <br>
        even from without it is apparent that they are built to create as few shadows as possible<br> 
        and to expose the interior to as much light as possible. <br>
        If the roof of a Japanese house is a parasol, <br>
        the roof of a Western house is no more than a cap, <br>
        with as small a visor as possible so as to allow the sunlight to penetrate directly beneath the eaves. <br>
     
        There are no doubt all sorts of reasons-climate, building materials-for the deep Japanese eaves. <br>
        The fact that we did not use glass, concrete, and bricks, <br>
        for instance, made a low roof necessary to keep off the driving wind and rain. <br>
        A light room would no doubt have been more convenient for us, too, than a dark room. <br>
        The quality that we call beauty, however, must always grow from the realities of life, <br>
        and our ancestors, forced to live in dark rooms, presently came to discover beauty in shadows, <br>
        ultimately to guide shadows towards beauty's ends. 
     </pre>

    <h2>Architecture and Light:</h2>
    <pre>
        And so it has come to be that the beauty of a Japanese room depends on a variation of shadows, <br>
        heavy shadows against light shadows-it has nothing else. <br>
        Westerners are amazed at the simplicity of Japanese rooms, <br>
        perceiving in them no more than ashen walls bereft of ornament. <br>
        Their reaction is understandable, but it betrays a failure to comprehend the mystery of shadows. <br>

        Out beyond the sitting room, which the rays of the sun can at best but barely reach, <br>
        we extend the eaves or build on a veranda, putting the sunlight at still greater a remove. <br>
        The light from the garden steals in but dimly through paper-paneled doors, <br>
        and it is precisely this indirect light that makes for us the charm of a room. <br>
        We do our walls in neutral colors so that the sad, fragile, dying rays can sink into absolute repose. <br>
        The storehouse, kitchen, hallways, and such may have a glossy finish, <br>
        but the walls of the sitting room will almost always be of day textured with fine sand. <br>
        A luster here would destroy the soft fragile beauty of the feeble light. <br>
        We delight in the mere sight of the delicate glow of fading rays clinging to the surface of a dusky wall, <br>
        there to live out what little life remains to them. <br>

        We never tire of the sight, for to us this pale glow and these dim shadows far surpass any ornament. <br>
        And so, as we must if we are not to disturb the glow, we finish the walls with sand in a single neutral color. <br>
        The hue may differ from room to room, but the degree of difference will be ever so slight; <br>
        not so much a difference in color as in shade, a difference that will seem to exist only in the mood of the viewer. <br>
        And from these delicate differences in the hue of the walls, the shadows in each room take on a tinge peculiarly their own.

    <h2>Art and Performance:</h2>
    <pre>
        Of course the Japanese room does have its picture alcove, and in it a hanging scroll and a flower arrangement. <br>
        But the scroll and the flowers serve not as ornament but rather to give depth to the shadows. <br>
        We value a scroll above all for the way it blends with the walls of the alcove, <br>
        and thus we consider the mounting quite as important as the calligraphy or painting. <br>
        Even the greatest masterpiece will lose its worth as a scroll if it fails to blend with the alcove, <br>
        while a work of no particular distinction may blend beautifully with the room and <br>
        set off to unexpected advantage both itself and its surroundings. <br>
        Wherein lies the power of an otherwise ordinary work to produce such an effect? <br>
        Most often the paper, the ink, the fabric of the mounting will possess a certain look of antiquity, <br>
        and this look of antiquity will strike just the right balance with the darkness of the alcove and room.<br>

        We have all had the experience, on a visit to one of the great temples of Kyoto or Nara, <br>
        of being shown a scroll, one of the temple's treasures, hanging in a large, deeply recessed alcove. <br>
        So dark are these alcoves, even in bright daylight, that we can hardly discern the outlines of the work; <br>
        all we can do is listen to the explanation of the guide, follow as best we can the all-but invisible brush strokes, <br>
        and tell ourselves how magnificent a painting it must be. <br>
        Yet the combination of that blurred old painting and the dark alcove is one of absolute harmony. <br>
        The lack of clarity, far from disturbing us, seems rather to suit the painting perfectly.<br>

        For the painting here is nothing more than another delicate surface upon which the faint, <br>
        frail light can play; it performs precisely the same function as the sand-textured wall. <br>
        This is why we attach such importance to age and patina. <br>
        A new painting, even one done in ink monochrome or subtle pastels, <br>
        can quite destroy the shadows of an alcove, unless it is selected with the greatest care.

    <h2>Daily Life and Culture:</h2>
    <pre>
        A Japanese room might be likened to an inkwash painting, <br>
        the paper-paneled shoji being the expanse where the ink is thinnest, <br>
        and the alcove where it is darkest. <br>
        Whenever I see the alcove of a tastefully built Japanese room, <br>
        I marvel at our comprehension of the secrets of shadows, our sensitive use of shadow and light. <br>
        For the beauty of the alcove is not the work of some clever device. <br>
        An empty space is marked off with plain wood and plain walls, <br>
        so that the light drawn into it forms dim shadows within emptiness. <br>
        There is nothing more. And yet, when we gaze into the darkness that gathers behind the crossbeam, <br>
        around the flower vase, beneath the shelves, though we know perfectly well it is mere shadow, <br>
        we are overcome with the feeling that in this small corner of the atmosphere there reigns complete and utter silence; <br>
        that here in the darkness immutable tranquility holds sway. <br>
        The "mysterious Orient" of which Westerners speak probably refers to the uncanny silence of these dark places. <br>
        And even we as children would feel an inexpressible chill as we peered into <br>
        the depths of an alcove to which the sunlight had never penetrated. <br>
        Where lies the key to this mystery? illtimately it is the magic of shadows. <br>
        Were the shadows to be banished from its comers, <br>
        the alcove would in that instant revert to mere void.<br>

        This was the genius of our ancestors, <br>
        that by cutting off the light from this empty space they imparted to the world of shadows that <br>
        formed there a quality of mystery and depth superior to that of any wall painting or ornament. <br>
        The technique seems simple, but was by no means so simply achieved. <br>
        We can imagine with little difficulty what extraordinary pains were taken with <br>
        each invisible detail-the placement of the window in the shelving recess, the depth of the crossbeam, the height of the threshold. <br>
        But for me the most exquisite touch is-the pale white glow of the shoji in the study bay; <br>
        I need only pause before it and I forget the passage of time.

    <h2>Conclusion and Personal Reflection:</h2>
    <pre>
        The study bay, as the name suggests, was originally a projecting window built to provide a place for reading. <br>
        Over the years it came to be regarded as no more than a source of light for the alcove; <br>
        but most often it serves not so much to illuminate the alcove as to soften the sidelong rays from without, <br>
        to filter them through paper panels. There is a cold and desolate tinge to the light by the time it reaches these panels. <br>
        The little sunlight from the garden that manages to make its way beneath the eaves <br>
        and through the corridors has by then lost its power to illuminate, <br>
        seems drained of the complexion of life. It can do no more than accentuate the whiteness of the paper. <br>
        I sometimes linger before these panels and study the surface of the paper, bright, <br>
        but giving no impression of brilliance.<br>

        In temple architecture the main room stands at a considerable distance from the garden; <br>
        so dilute is the light there that no matter what the season, on fair days or cloudy, morning, midday, <br>
        or evening, the pale, white glow scarcely varies. <br>
        And the shadows at the interstices of the ribs seem strangely immobile, <br>
        as if dust collected in the corners had become a part of the paper itself. <br>
        I blink in uncertainty at this dreamlike luminescence, <br>
        feeling as though some misty film were blunting my vision. <br>
        The light from the pale white paper, powerless to dispel the heavy darkness of the alcove, <br>
        is instead repelled by the darkness, creating a world of confusion where dark and light are indistinguishable. <br>
        Have not you yourselves sensed a difference in the light that suffuses such a room, <br>
        a rare tranquility not found in ordinary light? <br>
        Have you never felt a sort of fear in the face of the ageless, <br>
        a fear that in that room you might lose all consciousness of the passage of time, <br>
        that untold years might pass and upon emerging you should find you had grown old and gray?<br>

    <h2>Philosophical Reflections:</h2>
    <pre>
        And surely you have seen, in the darkness of the innermost rooms of these huge buildings, <br>
        to which sunlight never penetrates, how the gold leaf of a sliding door or screen will pick up a distant glimmer from the garden, <br>
        then suddenly send forth an ethereal glow, <br>
        a faint golden light cast into the enveloping darkness, like the glow upon the horizon at sunset. <br>
        In no other setting is gold quite so exquisitely beautiful. <br>
        You walk past, turning to look again, and yet again; <br>
        and as you move away the golden surface of the paper glows ever more deeply, <br>
        changing not in a flash, but growing slowly, steadily brighter, like color rising in the face of a giant. <br>
        Or again you may find that the gold dust of the background, which until that moment had only a dull, sleepy luster, will, <br>
        as you move past, suddenly gleam forth as if it had burst into flame.<br>

        How, in such a dark place, gold draws so much light to itself is a mystery to me. <br>
        But I see why in ancient times statues of the Buddha were gilt with gold and why gold leaf covered the walls of the homes of the nobility. <br>
        Modem man, in his well-lit house, knows nothing of the beauty of gold; <br>
        but those who lived in the dark houses of the past were not merely captivated by its beauty, <br>
        they also knew its practical value; for gold, in these dim rooms, must have served the function of a reflector. <br>
        Their use of gold leaf and gold dust was not mere extravagance. <br>
        Its reflective properties were put to use as a source of illumination. <br>
        Silver and other metals quickly lose their gloss, but gold retains its brilliance indefinitely to light the darkness of the room. <br>
        This is why gold was held in such incredibly high esteem.
