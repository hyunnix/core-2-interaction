        Of course the Japanese room does have its picture alcove, and in it a hanging scroll and a flower arrangement. <br> <br>
        But the scroll and the flowers serve not as ornament but rather to give depth to the shadows. <br> <br>
        We value a scroll above all for the way it blends with the walls of the alcove, <br> <br>
        and thus we consider the mounting quite as important as the calligraphy or painting. <br> <br>
        Even the greatest masterpiece will lose its worth as a scroll if it fails to blend with the alcove, <br> <br>
        while a work of no particular distinction may blend beautifully with the room and <br> <br>
        set off to unexpected advantage both itself and its surroundings. <br> <br>
        Wherein lies the power of an otherwise ordinary work to produce such an effect? <br> <br>
        Most often the paper, the ink, the fabric of the mounting will possess a certain look of antiquity, <br> <br>
        and this look of antiquity will strike just the right balance with the darkness of the alcove and room.<br> <br> <br>

        We have all had the experience, on a visit to one of the great temples of Kyoto or Nara, <br> <br>
        of being shown a scroll, one of the temple's treasures, hanging in a large, deeply recessed alcove. <br> <br>
        So dark are these alcoves, even in bright daylight, that we can hardly discern the outlines of the work; <br> <br>
        all we can do is listen to the explanation of the guide, follow as best we can the all-but invisible brush strokes, <br> <br>
        and tell ourselves how magnificent a painting it must be. <br> <br>
        Yet the combination of that blurred old painting and the dark alcove is one of absolute harmony. <br> <br>
        The lack of clarity, far from disturbing us, seems rather to suit the painting perfectly.<br> <br> <br>

        For the painting here is nothing more than another delicate surface upon which the faint, <br> <br>
        frail light can play; it performs precisely the same function as the sand-textured wall. <br> <br>
        This is why we attach such importance to age and patina. <br> <br>
        A new painting, even one done in ink monochrome or subtle pastels, <br> <br>
        can quite destroy the shadows of an alcove, unless it is selected with the greatest care. <br> <br>
