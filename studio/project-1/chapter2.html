    <p>
        In making for ourselves a place to live, <br>
        we first spread a parasol to throw a shadow on the earth, <br>
        and in the pale light of the shadow we put together a house. <br>
        There are of course roofs on Western houses too, <br>
        but they are less to keep off the sun than to keep off the wind and the dew; <br>
        even from without it is apparent that they are built to create as few shadows as possible<br> 
        and to expose the interior to as much light as possible. <br>
        If the roof of a Japanese house is a parasol, <br>
        the roof of a Western house is no more than a cap, <br>
        with as small a visor as possible so as to allow the sunlight to penetrate directly beneath the eaves. <br>
     
        There are no doubt all sorts of reasons-climate, building materials-for the deep Japanese eaves. <br>
        The fact that we did not use glass, concrete, and bricks, <br>
        for instance, made a low roof necessary to keep off the driving wind and rain. <br>
        A light room would no doubt have been more convenient for us, too, than a dark room. <br>
        The quality that we call beauty, however, must always grow from the realities of life, <br>
        and our ancestors, forced to live in dark rooms, presently came to discover beauty in shadows, <br>
        ultimately to guide shadows towards beauty's ends.Â
