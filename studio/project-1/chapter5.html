        A Japanese room might be likened to an inkwash painting, <br> <br>
        the paper-paneled shoji being the expanse where the ink is thinnest, <br> <br>
        and the alcove where it is darkest. <br> <br>
        Whenever I see the alcove of a tastefully built Japanese room, <br> <br>
        I marvel at our comprehension of the secrets of shadows, our sensitive use of shadow and light. <br> <br>
        For the beauty of the alcove is not the work of some clever device. <br> <br>
        An empty space is marked off with plain wood and plain walls, <br> <br>
        so that the light drawn into it forms dim shadows within emptiness. <br> <br>
        There is nothing more. And yet, when we gaze into the darkness that gathers behind the crossbeam, <br> <br>
        around the flower vase, beneath the shelves, though we know perfectly well it is mere shadow, <br> <br>
        we are overcome with the feeling that in this small corner of the atmosphere there reigns complete and utter silence; <br> <br>
        that here in the darkness immutable tranquility holds sway. <br> <br>
        The "mysterious Orient" of which Westerners speak probably refers to the uncanny silence of these dark places. <br> <br>
        And even we as children would feel an inexpressible chill as we peered into <br> <br>
        the depths of an alcove to which the sunlight had never penetrated. <br> <br>
        Where lies the key to this mystery? illtimately it is the magic of shadows. <br> <br>
        Were the shadows to be banished from its comers, <br> <br>
        the alcove would in that instant revert to mere void. <br> <br> <br> <br>

        This was the genius of our ancestors, <br> <br>
        that by cutting off the light from this empty space they imparted to the world of shadows that <br> <br>
        formed there a quality of mystery and depth superior to that of any wall painting or ornament. <br> <br>
        The technique seems simple, but was by no means so simply achieved. <br> <br>
        We can imagine with little difficulty what extraordinary pains were taken with <br> <br>
        each invisible detail-the placement of the window in the shelving recess, the depth of the crossbeam, the height of the threshold. <br> <br>
        But for me the most exquisite touch is-the pale white glow of the shoji in the study bay; <br> <br>
        I need only pause before it and I forget the passage of time. <br> <br> <br> <br>
