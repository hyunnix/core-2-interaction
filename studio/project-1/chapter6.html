        The study bay, as the name suggests, was originally a projecting window built to provide a place for reading. <br>
        Over the years it came to be regarded as no more than a source of light for the alcove; <br>
        but most often it serves not so much to illuminate the alcove as to soften the sidelong rays from without, <br>
        to filter them through paper panels. There is a cold and desolate tinge to the light by the time it reaches these panels. <br>
        The little sunlight from the garden that manages to make its way beneath the eaves <br>
        and through the corridors has by then lost its power to illuminate, <br>
        seems drained of the complexion of life. It can do no more than accentuate the whiteness of the paper. <br>
        I sometimes linger before these panels and study the surface of the paper, bright, <br>
        but giving no impression of brilliance.<br>

        In temple architecture the main room stands at a considerable distance from the garden; <br>
        so dilute is the light there that no matter what the season, on fair days or cloudy, morning, midday, <br>
        or evening, the pale, white glow scarcely varies. <br>
        And the shadows at the interstices of the ribs seem strangely immobile, <br>
        as if dust collected in the corners had become a part of the paper itself. <br>
        I blink in uncertainty at this dreamlike luminescence, <br>
        feeling as though some misty film were blunting my vision. <br>
        The light from the pale white paper, powerless to dispel the heavy darkness of the alcove, <br>
        is instead repelled by the darkness, creating a world of confusion where dark and light are indistinguishable. <br>
        Have not you yourselves sensed a difference in the light that suffuses such a room, <br>
        a rare tranquility not found in ordinary light? <br>
        Have you never felt a sort of fear in the face of the ageless, <br>
        a fear that in that room you might lose all consciousness of the passage of time, <br>
        that untold years might pass and upon emerging you should find you had grown old and gray?<br>
