        And so it has come to be that the beauty of a Japanese room depends on a variation of shadows, <br> <br>
        heavy shadows against light shadows-it has nothing else. <br> <br>
        Westerners are amazed at the simplicity of Japanese rooms, <br> <br>
        perceiving in them no more than ashen walls bereft of ornament. <br> <br>
        Their reaction is understandable, but it betrays a failure to comprehend the mystery of shadows. <br> <br> <br>

        Out beyond the sitting room, which the rays of the sun can at best but barely reach, <br> <br>
        we extend the eaves or build on a veranda, putting the sunlight at still greater a remove. <br> <br>
        The light from the garden steals in but dimly through paper-paneled doors, <br> <br>
        and it is precisely this indirect light that makes for us the charm of a room. <br> <br>
        We do our walls in neutral colors so that the sad, fragile, dying rays can sink into absolute repose. <br> <br>
        The storehouse, kitchen, hallways, and such may have a glossy finish, <br> <br>
        but the walls of the sitting room will almost always be of day textured with fine sand. <br> <br>
        A luster here would destroy the soft fragile beauty of the feeble light. <br> <br>
        We delight in the mere sight of the delicate glow of fading rays clinging to the surface of a dusky wall, <br> <br>
        there to live out what little life remains to them. <br> <br> <br>

        We never tire of the sight, for to us this pale glow and these dim shadows far surpass any ornament. <br> <br>
        And so, as we must if we are not to disturb the glow, we finish the walls with sand in a single neutral color. <br> <br>
        The hue may differ from room to room, but the degree of difference will be ever so slight; <br> <br>
        not so much a difference in color as in shade, a difference that will seem to exist only in the mood of the viewer. <br> <br>
        And from these delicate differences in the hue of the walls, the shadows in each room take on a tinge peculiarly their own. <br> <br>
